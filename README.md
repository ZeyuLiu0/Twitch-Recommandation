# Content Based Recommender Engines
A content based recommender works with data that the user provides, either explicitly (rating) or implicitly (clicking on a link). Based on that data, a user profile is generated, which is then used to make suggestions to the user. As the user provides more inputs or takes actions on the recommendations, the engine becomes more and more accurate.

# Item-Based Collaborative Filtering (IB-CF)
Item-item collaborative filtering is one kind of recommendation method which looks for similar items based on the items users have already liked or positively interacted with. It was developed by Amazon in 1998 and plays a great role in Amazon’s success.

# User-Based Collaborative Filtering (UB-CF)
User-Based Collaborative Filtering is a technique used to predict the items that a user might like on the basis of ratings given to that item by the other users who have similar taste with that of the target user.
